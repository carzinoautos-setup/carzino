## Recommendations by Scale

### For 1,000-10,000 Vehicles:
1. **DealerOn** - Purpose-built, cost-effective
2. **Modified WooCommerce** - Leverage existing setup
3. **Shopify Plus** - If under 10K vehicles

### For 10,000-100,000 Vehicles:
1. **Custom Solution** - Best long-term investment
2. **BigCommerce Enterprise** - With heavy optimization
3. **Cox Automotive Partnership** - Proven scale

### For 100,000+ Vehicles:
1. **Custom Solution** - Only viable long-term option
2. **Cox Automotive White Label** - Leverage their infrastructure
3. **Automotive Marketplace** - Join existing platforms

## Key Insights

### Why E-Commerce Platforms Struggle with Automotive:
1. **Search Complexity**: Cars need 20+ filter criteria
2. **Geographic Requirements**: Location-based inventory
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Instant availability changes
4. **Data Richness**: Extensive vehicle specifications
5. **Industry Workflows**: Automotive-specific processes

### When to Choose Each Approach:
- **Small Scale (<10K)**: Automotive platforms (DealerOn)
- **Medium Scale (10K-100K)**: Modified e-commerce or custom
- **Large Scale (100K+)**: Custom solution or automotive partnerships
- **Enterprise Scale (1M+)**: Custom infrastructure mandatory

The bottom line: **Standard e-commerce platforms are not designed for the automotive industry's unique requirements at scale.**
