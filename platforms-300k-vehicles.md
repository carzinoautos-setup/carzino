## Key Insights

### Platforms That Definitely Work at 300K:
✅ **DealerSocket** - Automotive-focused, proven
✅ **VinSolutions** - Cox Automotive backbone
✅ **Adobe Commerce** - Enterprise-grade catalog management
✅ **Elastic Path** - Modern headless architecture
✅ **Medusa.js** - Open source with unlimited scale potential

### What Makes 300K Feasible vs 3M:
- **Database**: PostgreSQL/MySQL can handle 300K efficiently
- **Search**: Single Elasticsearch cluster sufficient
- **Hosting**: Standard cloud hosting works
- **Team**: 5-10 person team vs 30-50 for 3M scale
- **Budget**: $150K-900K/year vs $5M-10M for 3M scale

The key difference is that 300K vehicles is within the "enterprise" tier rather than requiring completely custom infrastructure like 3M vehicles would.
