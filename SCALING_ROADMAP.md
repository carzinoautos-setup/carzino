## Critical Decision Points

### At 1,000 vehicles:
**Decision**: Continue with current WooCommerce or migrate to custom solution?
**Recommendation**: Begin Phase 1 migration to avoid technical debt

### At 10,000 vehicles:
**Decision**: Build vs Buy backend services?
**Recommendation**: Continue building - you're still in the sweet spot for custom development

### At 100,000 vehicles:
**Decision**: Continue custom development or partner with automotive platforms?
**Recommendation**: This is the critical decision point. Options:
1. **Continue building** (requires $5M+ annual investment)
2. **Partner with Cox Automotive** (use their infrastructure, keep your frontend)
3. **Hybrid approach** (use automotive data feeds, custom search/UX)

### At 1,000,000+ vehicles:
**Recommendation**: Unless you have $10M+ annual budget and enterprise team, consider:
- **White-label solution** from Cox/CDK
- **Data partnership** with major automotive platforms
- **Acquisition target** for larger automotive companies
